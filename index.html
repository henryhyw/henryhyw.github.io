## My Work Ethic

I wouldn't call myself a very hardworking student; in fact, I might even be a bit lazy since I often look for shortcuts. However, when it comes to things I'm passionate about, I dive in deep and never take shortcuts. I love immersing myself in the things I care about and will put in every effort to excel at them.
