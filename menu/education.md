<p>Here’s a snapshot of my academic path and the experiences that have shaped my learning.</p>

<p>I wouldn't say I'm an extremely hardworking student; in fact, I often look for shortcuts. But when it comes to things I'm passionate about, I dive in deep and never take shortcuts. I love immersing myself in what I care about and put in every effort to excel. Take my computer science courses, for instance—I spent a lot of time exploring interesting concepts beyond the textbook.</p>
