Here’s a snapshot of my academic path and the experiences that have shaped my learning.

I wouldn’t call myself a super hardworking student; in fact, I often look for shortcuts. However, when it comes to things I’m passionate about, I dive in deep and never deliberately take shortcuts. I love immersing myself in the things I care about and put in every effort to excel at them. With that being said, in most computer science courses, I spent far more time than others exploring those interesting concepts beyond the textbook.

## The University of Hong Kong

*September 2022 - Present*

I'm a third-year student at the [University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/), majoring in [Applied Artificial Intelligence](https://admissions.hku.hk/programmes/undergraduate-programmes/bachelor-of-arts-and-sciences-applied-artificial-intelligence).

I have taken a diverse range of courses including Python, C++, Java, Data Structures and Algorithms, Software Engineering, Multivariable Calculus, Linear Algebra, Probability and Statistics, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Data Science.

Beyond my coursework, I served as a Student Representative on the CAES Staff-Student Consultative Committee and am currently a Student Peer Advisor (SPA), offering advice and helping freshmen and sophomores make study and career plans.

I completed my junior high, high school, and International Baccalaureate diplomas at [Shanghai High School International Division](https://www.shsid.org/).

For my IB diploma, I studied a broad array of subjects including computer science, mathematics, economics, physics, English, and Chinese.

In addition to my coursework, I co-founded SHSID Musix Board, a popular music opinion-sharing website, and led the Coding Club.

<!-- ## Shibei Junior High School
