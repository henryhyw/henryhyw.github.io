Hey there! Hereâ€™s a snapshot of my academic path and the experiences that have shaped my learning.

I'm a third-year student at the [University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/), majoring in Applied Artificial Intelligence. Before this, I completed my International Baccalaureate diploma at [Shanghai High School International Division](https://www.shsid.org/), which was the top IB school in Mainland China at the time. Prior to that, I attended the Science Class at [Shanghai Shibei Junior High School](http://www.sbc.edu.sh.cn/), known as the best junior high school class for STEM subjects in Shanghai.
