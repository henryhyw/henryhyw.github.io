Hey there! Hereâ€™s a snapshot of my academic path and the experiences that have shaped my learning.

I'm a third-year student at the [University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/), majoring in [Applied Artificial Intelligence](https://admissions.hku.hk/programmes/undergraduate-programmes/bachelor-of-arts-and-sciences-applied-artificial-intelligence).

Before this, I completed my International Baccalaureate diploma at [Shanghai High School International Division](https://www.shsid.org/), which was the top IB school in Mainland China at the time.

Prior to that, I attended the Science Class at [Shanghai Shibei Junior High School](http://www.sbc.edu.sh.cn/), known as the best junior high school class for STEM subjects in Shanghai.

I wouldn't call myself a very hardworking student; in fact, I might even be a bit lazy since I often look for shortcuts. However, when it comes to things I'm passionate about, I dive in deep and never take shortcuts. I love immersing myself in the things I care about and will put in every effort to excel at them.
