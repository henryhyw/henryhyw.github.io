Here’s a snapshot of my academic path and the experiences that have shaped my learning.

## My Work Ethos

I wouldn’t call myself a super hardworking student; in fact, I often look for shortcuts. However, when it comes to things I’m passionate about, I dive in deep and never deliberately take shortcuts. I love immersing myself in the things I care about and put in every effort to excel at them. With that being said, in most computer science courses, I spent far more time than others exploring those interesting concepts beyond the textbook.

I completed my junior high, high school, and International Baccalaureate diplomas at [Shanghai High School International Division](https://www.shsid.org/).

For my IB diploma, I studied a broad array of subjects including computer science, mathematics, economics, physics, English, and Chinese.

In addition to my coursework, I co-founded SHSID Musix Board, a popular music opinion-sharing website, and led the Coding Club.

<!-- ## Shibei Junior High School
