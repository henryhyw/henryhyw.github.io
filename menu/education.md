title: My Learning Journey So Far

Here’s a snapshot of my academic path and the experiences that have shaped my learning.

I wouldn't say I'm an extremely hardworking student; in fact, I often look for shortcuts. But when it comes to things I'm passionate about, I dive in deep and never take shortcuts. I love immersing myself in what I care about and put in every effort to excel. Take my computer science courses, for instance—I spent a lot of time exploring interesting concepts beyond the textbook.

I completed my junior high, high school, and International Baccalaureate diplomas at [Shanghai High School International Division](https://www.shsid.org/).

For my IB diploma, I studied a broad array of subjects including computer science, mathematics, economics, physics, English, and Chinese.

In addition to my coursework, I co-founded SHSID Musix Board, a school-wide popular music opinion-sharing platform, and led the Coding Club.

<!-- ## Shibei Junior High School
