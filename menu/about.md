### Education Journey

I'm a third-year student at the University of Hong Kong, majoring in Applied Artificial Intelligence. Before this, I completed my International Baccalaureate diploma at Shanghai High School International Division, which was the top IB school in Mainland China at the time. Prior to that, I attended the Science Class at Shanghai Shibei Junior High School, known as the best junior high school class for STEM subjects in Shanghai.

### My Work Ethic

I wouldn't call myself a very hardworking student; in fact, I might even be a bit lazy since I often look for shortcuts. However, when it comes to things I'm passionate about, I dive in deep and never take shortcuts. I love immersing myself in the things I care about and will put in every effort to excel at them.
