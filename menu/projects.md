## BRIGHT: A Benchmark for Reasoning-Intensive Information Retrieval

*December 2023 - May 2024*

Associated with *[XLANG Lab at the University of Hong Kong](https://www.xlang.ai/)*

I had an opportunity to work on BRIGHT, a benchmark designed to evaluate how well models can reason through complex queries. My responsibilities included conducting literature reviews, gathering and analyzing data from public forums, creating query-document pairs, and testing coding-related queries.

## My Early Projects in Junior High and High School

During my junior high and high school years, I got to work on a bunch of projects that really sparked my love for computer science. Some of the highlights were creating a batch downloader for Scientific American episodes, developing a few Chrome extensions, building a website for Kiwiview International Limited, and making an economics graph generator called Econographer. These projects show just how excited I was (and still am) about programming and solving problems.
