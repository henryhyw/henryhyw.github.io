      <img src="/assets/img/slr.png" style="height:6vh;">
      <p>Under the supervision of Dr. Man-kit Lee, I am researching human memory systems and learning behaviors. My work involves developing a computational model to simulate these processes, alongside conducting literature reviews on artificial neural networks, reinforcement learning, and cognitive neuroscience.

      <h3>BRIGHT: A Benchmark for Reasoning-Intensive Information Retrieval</h3>
      <h4>Associated with <a href="https://www.xlang.ai/"><b>XLANG Lab</b></a></h4>
      <img src="/assets/img/xlang.png" style="height:6vh;">
      <p>I had an opportunity to work on BRIGHT, a benchmark designed to evaluate how well models can reason through complex queries. My responsibilities included conducting literature reviews, gathering and analyzing data from public forums, creating query-document pairs, and testing coding-related queries.</p>

      <h3>My Early Projects in Junior High and High School</h3>

      </div>
      <p>During my junior high and high school years, I got to work on a bunch of projects that really sparked my love for coding. Some of the highlights were creating a batch downloader for Scientific American episodes, developing a few Chrome extensions, building a website for Kiwiview International Limited, and making an economics graph generator called Econographer. These projects show just how excited I was (and still am) about programming and solving problems.</p>
