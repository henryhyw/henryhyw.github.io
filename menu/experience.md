## Contributor in an Information Retrieval Research Project

*December 2023 - May 2024*

*[Natural Language Processing Group at the University of Hong Kong](https://hkunlp.github.io/)*

<img src="/assets/img/hku.jpeg" style="height:8vh;">

I had an amazing opportunity to work on BRIGHT, a benchmark designed to evaluate how well models can reason through complex queries. Collaborating with Princeton University and Google Cloud AI Research made the project even more exciting!

It was a fascinating deep dive into how information is processed and understood. I spent a lot of time gathering and analyzing data from public forums, creating query-document pairs, and testing coding-related queries to ensure our models were accurate.

As one of the co-authors, I contributed to a paper about the project, which we submitted to NeurIPS and is currently under review. This project was a challenging yet incredibly rewarding experience.
