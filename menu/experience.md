*[Kiwiview International Limited](https://www.kiwiviewintl.co.nz/uk-en/index.php)*

*June 2023 - December 2023*

I had the opportunity to work with a New Zealand company that provides educational services for international study and customized travel solutions. This company is actually a family endeavor that my parents and I established together from the start. I led the design, development, and hosting of their website using HTML, JavaScript, CSS, PHP, and MySQL. I also gathered, analyzed, and visualized global study and travel trends using various Python packages. (Details are confidential)

*July 2022 - May 2023*

Tutoring has been a passion of mine, and during this period, I helped international high school students ace their AP and IB math and computer science exams. I also prepared them for AMC 8 & AMC 10 competitions and assisted with their school coursework to boost their understanding and performance.

## Other Projects

### Contributor in an Information Retrieval Research Project

*[Natural Language Processing Group at the University of Hong Kong](https://hkunlp.github.io/)*

*December 2023 - May 2024*

I had an amazing opportunity to work on BRIGHT, a benchmark designed to evaluate how well models can reason through complex queries. Collaborating with Princeton University and Google Cloud AI Research made the project even more exciting!

It was a fascinating deep dive into how information is processed and understood. I spent a lot of time gathering and analyzing data from public forums, creating query-document pairs, and testing coding-related queries to ensure our models were accurate.

As one of the co-authors, I contributed to a paper about the project, which we submitted to NeurIPS and is currently under review. This project was a challenging yet incredibly rewarding experience.
