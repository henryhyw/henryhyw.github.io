My computer science teacher demonstrated how a batch script can create folders automatically. From that moment, I was fascinated by how computers could be programmed to do all sorts of cool things. I taught myself the basics of Java and Python and started building simple apps, like a contact notebook app in Java and an advanced number guessing game with user accounts and game history logged in text files.</p><p>Here are some screenshots of this first app (contact notebook) I made.</p><div class=\\\"scroll-container\\\"><img src=\\\"/assets/img/contactnotebook1.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Contact Notebook Screenshot 1\\\"><img src=\\\"/assets/img/contactnotebook2.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Contact Notebook Screenshot 2\\\"></div><h2>Batch Downloading Scientific American Episodes</h2><p>In my first year of junior high, I decided to practice English and discovered the podcast called Scientific American. At that time, I was using an MP3 player that supported playing audio, images, and texts. So, I developed an app to batch download audios, scripts, and images from Scientific American episodes. The app included a user account system that could record the episodes a user had downloaded and continue from where they left off next time.</p><p>Here are some screenshots of this app.</p><div class=\\\"scroll-container\\\"><img src=\\\"/assets/img/safetcher1.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"SA Fetcher Screenshot 1\\\"><img src=\\\"/assets/img/safetcher2.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"SA Fetcher Screenshot 2\\\"><img src=\\\"/assets/img/safetcher3.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"SA Fetcher Screenshot 3\\\"><img src=\\\"/assets/img/safetcher4.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"SA Fetcher Screenshot 4\\\"></div><h2>Chrome Extension Experiments</h2><p>In my second year of junior high, I started exploring Chrome extensions. Living in Mainland China made me curious about things that weren&#39;t easily accessible, so I&#39;d use a VPN to access Google-related stuff. It amazed me that these small apps in the browser could do so much, like turning the screen dark for YouTube videos. So, I learned how to develop and publish Chrome extensions and created a few:</p><ul><li><strong>Easy QR Code</strong>: Displays QR codes for the current website, makes your own QR codes, and converts text to QR codes.</li><li><strong>Page Muter</strong>: Mutes the audio or video of a specific tab.</li><li><strong>Image Fetcher</strong>: Batch downloads images from the current website.</li><li><strong>SA Fetcher</strong>: Batch downloads audios, scripts, and images from Scientific American episodes.

I now realize that this was illegal, but at the time, I wasn&#39;t aware of that. Although I&#39;m not proud of it, I still want to mention it because it was a masterpiece for a first-year high school student.</p><p>I did a lot of research on web scraping and managed to crack the links of paid songs from various music streaming services. With this app, users could download songs with the link of the song page from QQ Music, Netease Music, KuGou Music, and KuWo Music, with the desired sound quality. Users could also batch download songs from a singer with a specified number of pages. I even created a user account system where some functions, like downloading lossless audio, were only available to VIP users.</p><p>It took me several months to develop this app, but it only lasted for half a year because I later realized it wasn&#39;t quite legal, so I shut it down. Despite that, it remains one of my fondest memories. By that time, it had 413 users, with 228 QQ Music playlist downloads, 1294 QQ Music single downloads, 523 NetEase Music single downloads, 23 KuGou Music single downloads, and 47 KuWo Music single downloads.</p><p>Here are some screenshots of the app, which is in Simplified Chinese since the users were from Mainland China.</p><div class=\\\"scroll-container\\\"><img src=\\\"/assets/img/musicdownloader1.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Music Downloader Screenshot 1\\\"><img src=\\\"/assets/img/musicdownloader2.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Music Downloader Screenshot 2\\\"><img src=\\\"/assets/img/musicdownloader3.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Music Downloader Screenshot 3\\\"><img src=\\\"/assets/img/musicdownloader4.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Music Downloader Screenshot 4\\\"><img src=\\\"/assets/img/musicdownloader5.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Music Downloader Screenshot 5\\\"><img src=\\\"/assets/img/musicdownloader6.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Music Downloader Screenshot 6\\\"><img src=\\\"/assets/img/musicdownloader7.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Music Downloader Screenshot 7\\\"></div><h2>Building Kiwiview&#39;s Website</h2><p>In my second year of high school, I started building a website for Kiwiview International Limited, a New Zealand company co-owned by my parents and a Kiwi.
