You can also call me Henry. I was born in <strong>Taiwan</strong> and grew up in <strong>Shanghai</strong>. I’ve also had the chance to live in <strong>Hawke’s Bay, New Zealand</strong>. Currently, I'm pursuing my degree in <strong>Hong Kong</strong>.</p>\n          \n      <img src=\"/assets/img/henry.jpg\" alt=\"Henry\">\n    \n      <p>I am a third-year student at the <strong>University of Hong Kong</strong>, majoring in <strong>Applied Artificial Intelligence</strong>. Meanwhile, I work as a part-time research assistant in the <strong>SLR Lab at HKU</strong>, where I investigate intersections in neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and education. I also work in the <strong>PDS Lab at HKU</strong>, focusing on integrating generative AI and LLM with personalized learning. Additionally, I am a full-time Student Work Placement Intern at <strong>HSBC</strong>, working in the Digital Transformation Department.

I study how AI can help explain and model our learning behaviors.</p>\n    \n      <h2>On a More Personal Level</h2>\n    \n      <p>In my free time, I love spending time by the ocean. When I lived in New Zealand, I often visited the beautiful <strong>Napier Oceanside</strong>. When I was in Europe, I loved relaxing at the <strong>Mediterranean Sea</strong>, sunbathing, swimming, and enjoying the serene beauty of the water. When I’m near school, you can often find me at the <strong>Kennedy Town Praya</strong>, enjoying the calm and peaceful waterfront. There’s something incredibly soothing about the ocean that I just can’t get enough of.</p>\n    \n      <video id=\"videoElement\" muted autoplay loop playsinline>\n          <source src=\"/assets/vid/napier.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n      </video>\n      <img src=\"/assets/img/napier.png\" alt=\"Travel\" class=\"fallback-image\" style=\"display: none;\">\n    \n      <p>I love traveling and have had the chance to see some amazing places around the world. I’ve been awestruck by the <strong>Sagrada Família</strong> in Barcelona, amazed by the ancient <strong>Acropolis</strong> in Athens, inspired by the <strong>Statue of Liberty</strong> in New York, and enchanted by the <strong>Redwoods</strong> in Rotorua. Each of these experiences has left me with unforgettable memories and a deep appreciation for the beauty and diversity of our world.</p>\n    \n      <blockquote>\n          \"Once you have traveled, the voyage never ends, but is played out over and over again in the quietest chambers.
