title: Who I Am
---

Hey there! I’m Henry. I was born in **Taiwan** but grew up in the bustling city of **Shanghai**. I’ve also had the chance to live in **Hawke’s Bay, New Zealand**. Currently, I'm pursuing my degree in vibrant **Hong Kong**.

I am a third-year student at the **University of Hong Kong**, majoring in **Applied Artificial Intelligence**. Meanwhile, I work as a part-time research assistant in the **SLR Lab at HKU**, where I investigate intersections in neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and education. I also work in the **PDS Lab at HKU**, focusing on integrating generative AI and LLM with personalized learning. Additionally, I am a full-time Student Work Placement Intern at **HSBC**, working in the Digital Transformation Department. For more details, please visit my [education](https://henryhyw.github.io/education.html) and [work experience](https://henryhyw.github.io/work.html) pages.

In my free time, I love walking by the ocean. When I lived in New Zealand, I often visited the beautiful **Napier Oceanside**. Now that I’m back near school, you can often find me at the **Kennedy Town Seaside**, soaking in the peaceful vibes of the waterfront. There’s something incredibly calming about the ocean that I just can’t get enough of.

I love traveling and have had the chance to explore some amazing places around the world. I’ve marveled at the stunning **Sagrada Família** in Barcelona, stood in awe at the ancient **Acropolis** in Athens, gazed up at the iconic **Statue of Liberty** in the United States, wandered through the enchanting **Rotorua Redwoods** in New Zealand. Each of these experiences has left me with unforgettable memories and a deep appreciation for the beauty and diversity of our world.

Another passion of mine is diving into the world of computer science. I absolutely love coding. There’s nothing quite like the thrill of creating vibrant, functional programs from scratch. It’s amazing to see lines of code come together to build something real and impactful. Feel free to check out my early adventures in computer science—it was such a fun and exciting journey for me.
