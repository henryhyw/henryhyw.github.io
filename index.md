title: Who I Am
---

Hey there! I’m Wang Hanyu. You can call me Henry. I was born in Taiwan but grew up in the bustling city of Shanghai. I’ve also had the chance to live in Hawke’s Bay, New Zealand, where my mom currently lives.

In my free time, I love walking by the ocean. When I lived in New Zealand, I often visited the beautiful Napier Oceanside. Now that I’m back near school, you can often find me at the Kennedy Town Seaside, soaking in the peaceful vibes of the waterfront. There’s something incredibly calming about the ocean that I just can’t get enough of.

I love traveling and have had the chance to explore some amazing places around the world. I've marveled at the stunning Sagrada Família in Barcelona, stood in awe at the ancient Acropolis in Athens, and gazed up at the iconic Statue of Liberty in the United States. In New Zealand, I wandered through the enchanting Rotorua Redwoods. Each of these experiences has left me with unforgettable memories and a deep appreciation for the beauty and diversity of our world.

Another passion of mine is diving into the world of computer science. I absolutely love coding. There’s nothing quite like the thrill of creating vibrant, functional programs from scratch. It’s amazing to see lines of code come together to build something real and impactful. Feel free to check out my early adventures in computer science—it was such a fun and exciting journey for me.
